    <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We and our service providers may use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to remember your preferences, measure usage, and deliver functionality.

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your own. If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that we may transfer your information to the U.S. and other countries for processing. When transfers occur, we use safeguards to protect your information as required by applicable law.</p>
